/**
 * Pre-flight auth check: verify that authentication will work before starting analysis.
 *
 * - If an API key is provided, returns immediately (direct API auth).
 * - If no API key, verifies the `claude` binary exists on PATH so the SDK
 *   can use local Claude Code auth. Throws WardenAuthenticationError
 *   if the binary is missing.
 *
 * This catches the most common failure mode (binary not installed) early.
 * Subtler failures (binary exists but sandbox blocks IPC) are caught by the
 * isSubprocessError() handler in analyzeHunk().
